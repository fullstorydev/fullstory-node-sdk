# Welcome to FullStory NodeJS SDK contributing guide

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the FullStory NodeJS SDK project! We appreciate and welcome our community members to raise questions, open issues, or create PRs.

## Getting started

To get started with FullStory Server API, see [the developer guide](https://developer.fullstory.com/server/v2/getting-started/).

See project [README](https://github.com/fullstorydev/fullstory-node-sdk/blob/main/README.md) to get started with the NodeJS SDK.

## Create a new issue

If you notice any issues or anything that may be confusing to you, search to see if there's any [issue](https://github.com/fullstorydev/fullstory-node-sdk/issues) already created.

If an issue doesn't already exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/fullstorydev/fullstory-node-sdk/issues/new/choose).

## Create a PR

Follow the steps if you've noticed any issues that interest you and would like to create a PR to fix.

- Fork the repository.

- Set up the project locally following the instructions in [README](https://github.com/fullstorydev/fullstory-node-sdk/blob/main/README.md).

- Create and commit your changes to your feature branch.

- Once you are happy with your changes, [open a PR from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

- Describe your changes and make sure to link to the issue being addressed.

Some tips for successful PR:

- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so a member of the FullStory team can work on the PR.

- A FullStory team member may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. Address them by making changes and committing to your branch.

- Resolve any conversation in the PR, as they are addressed.
